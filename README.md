# YouTube Hate Speech Detection
This application analyzes YouTube comments to detect hate speech using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques.

## Overview
This tool helps identify and analyze hate speech in YouTube comments, providing a way to monitor and understand toxic content in social media platforms.

##ðŸŒŸ Main Features of Toxic Comment Detector

### 1. User Interface
- Clear title and application description
- Text area for comment input
- "Analyze" and "Clear text" buttons

### 2. Text Processing
### Automatic text cleaning:
- Character normalization
- URL removal
- Email removal
- Number removal
- Special character removal

### 3. Toxicity Analysis
- Uses a pre-trained BERT model (Dolcevitta/toxic-bert-model)
- Provides toxicity probability (0-100%)
- Binary classification (Toxic/Non-toxic)
- Result visualization with progress bar

### 4. Results Display
- Shows original and cleaned text
- Visual indicator of results (green for non-toxic, red for toxic)
- Progress bar for toxicity level
- Result interpretation guide:
  * 0-25%: Safe content
  * 25-50%: Potentially problematic content
  * 50-75%: Likely toxic content
  * 75-100%: Highly toxic content

### 5. Database Management
- Automatic prediction storage
- Queryable prediction history
- Statistics visualization:
  * Percentage of toxic comments
  * Total predictions made

### 6. Technical Features
- Model caching for better performance
- Error handling
- Responsive interface with columns
- Session state for text persistence

### 7. History Visualization
- Formatted table with all predictions
- Color coding for classifications
- Summarized history statistics
